    <h1>Embracing Diversity: Disability and Inclusion – Part 2</h1>
    <h2>Acceptability</h2>
    <p>Acceptability is the first and a major challenge which is faced by most of the people with diversity and disability even in the present era. Society has built a perception around diversity and disability, the basis on which, they have laid down the ways how they should be treated, what they can do, what they cannot do, what they feel, and how they react.

 Without accepting who we are, we cannot move forward from the phenomenon that we are different, and we would not be able to make others accept us as who we are. Instead of putting ourselves in certain criteria or a mold created by society for the people with the said diversity or disability, we should focus on including ourselves in the mainstream society rather than deviating from it and showcasing to them how we are equal.

 As per my understanding, we can do this by achieving acceptability of such people by breaking it down into 3 levels:</p>
    <h2>1. Family Acceptance: The Foundation of Empowerment</h2>
<p>
  I believe diversity starts and ends within the home of an individual. Once the family accepts the person as he/she/they are, they provide them with moral support . This helps them to stand up and accept that whatever constraints they are having do not limit them from considering themselves equal to others. Also, they do not need to follow any so-called guidelines associated with their diversity or disability for making decisions about their choices, education, lifestyle etc.

For example: when I lost my vision, I was just around 6 years old. and I was not mature enough to understand what was going on. At that time, my family accepted my disability and promoted me to do whatever a child with the ability to see does in their respective lives. They never hesitated to take me to public places and social gatherings for the fear of how people would react and what questions they would ask. The comfort, faith, and trust they used to show in me gradually became the traits associated with me, due to which everyone around started accepting me. This also allowed me to picture myself as equal and overcome the hesitation of being with other people.
</p>

<h2>2. Acceptance of people around us</h2>
<p>
  The next step is acceptance by the people around us because they are the only ones who can make people with diversity and disabilities feel inclusive in society. Once we start looking toward such people as they are indifferent, we would be better able to socialize with them, understand them, analyze how we can involve, support, and help them to improve.

 My neighbors, teachers, friends, and all other relatives never saw me as a child with limitations. Instead, they use to focus on how they can include me in the various activities in which my inability to see can cause hindrance.

 For example, I used to stay quiet and stay alone all the time at school. but one day my friends said why live like this, stand up and start living your life to the fullest. from that day, they always took me wherever they are going by holding my hands without any hesitation, including me in all the sports whether they have to make accommodations and changes in the rules of the games, speaking out about whatever they are studying so that I may also learn along with them, and never leaving me behind while having fun. All this helped me to forget my blindness and claim myself equally in society.</p>

<h2>Social acceptability</h2>
<p>
  Stereotype mentality regarding diversity and disability can be only overcome by spreading awareness and educating individuals. Once we achieve this, they would also be able to see people with diversity and disability through the same lens as they see others.

Many NGOs, government departments, and corporations are doing a lot to contribute to achieving this goal. But I feel if the people from the first 2 levels can share their first-hand experiences and learnings, it would also create awareness among the society since people would be better able to connect with such personal instances. Also, if people with diversity and disability can create awareness by displaying their potential, and what they can do, and communicating what are their reasonable requirements from society, it will help people to understand and change their perspective towards them.

For example, when I used to compete with everyone and succeed in the school and college, built relationships with everyone, influenced and motivated people around me, complete all the work assignments in the organization, and perform every activity with different ways of doing them, it helped people around me to understand that a constraint doesn’t limit someone’s ability to perform a task. They have some other ways of doing it. and they just must support me sometimes to help me find those solutions if I am unaware of any. By witnessing what I do and how I do it, they were able to learn how to support individuals with a similar disability if they encounter any in the future.</p>
