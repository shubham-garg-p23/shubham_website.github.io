    <h1>Embracing Diversity: Disability and Inclusion – Part 4</h1>
    <h2>Challenges in the Education Journey of People with Visual Impairment</h2>

    <p>The challenges in the journey of education of people with visual impairment are not just limited to Lack of awareness, unwillingness of institutions to teach, and finance. In fact, there are more hurdles in their path of education like:</p>

    <h2>1. Braille as the Solution</h2>
    <p>Everyone considers Braille as the solution for all the problems of reading and writing for the visually impaired. However, Braille comes with its challenges – it’s time-consuming, not all required material are available in Braille, and exams cannot be completed in a limited time with the help of Braille. To solve this problem, earlier I used to get these books and study notes recorded in the audio format with the help of my cousins. Later, I came to know about NGOs like National Association for the Blind, and many websites already have audio books available for the blind. By playing these recordings again and again, I used to understand the concepts and question answers. Later, when I learned operating computers, I used to study through PDFs of the books, and prepare my own study notes on MS Word, Excel, and Notepad, which made my studies quite easy.</p>

    <h2>2. Studying Subjects with Complex Concepts</h2>
    <p>Studying subjects like maths, science, accountancy, and other subjects involving data is not manageable for every blind student, because blind students have to put a lot of effort into understanding the lengthy concepts, performing all the calculations, practicing questions, visualizing graphs and figures, analyzing data, etc. Also, since screen reader software is not very much accessible in such things, they need someone’s help to study and understand such subjects. For this, my family, relatives, and teachers focused upon pushing me to perform calculations verbally. Initially, I used to count with the help of fingers, then learned tables as much as possible. Gradually, I was able to train my brain to perform calculations of large numbers without any support. For figures and graphs, they used to try to explain such things by forming that figure by holding my fingers or by creating that figure with the help of multiple objects. For example, in order to explain the quadrants, they used 2 pens, placed one of them vertically and the other horizontally. Similarly, for explaining to me the PPC graph of economics, they curved my palm in the shape of C, and then explained the placement of the combinations with the help of fingers of the other hand. Once we start doing such things from a young age itself, we prepare our brain to process such things. Regarding practicing the questions, I used to record the conversation between me and the other person explaining the concepts and examples. Then, I used to listen to that recording 3-4 times and try to construct various similar problems with different digits so that I could practice different questions related to a particular topic.</p>

    <h2>3. Writing Exams with a Scribe</h2>
    <p>Writing our exam with the help of a scribe is also not an easy task. However, these days, most places also have the provision of writing exams with the help of computers. But using a scribe is still the widely used option. Many times, these scribes are not aware of the spellings, symbols, terminologies, etc., of higher classes, due to which they end up reading the questions wrong and making mistakes in writing as well. This leads a blind student to face a lot of marks deductions and not being able to achieve the desired scores in the exam.</p>

    <h2>4. Lack of Accessible Material</h2>
    <p>Lack of accessible material is another challenge for the blind. Usually, except the course books recommended by the government, other books of various authors are not available in PDF or other accessible formats. Although the internet and online videos are gaining prominence for learning, for visually impaired individuals, it is hard to understand things from such content. This is because the creators do not always read out whatever they are writing, or do not speak out the specific point they are referring to while explaining something. This happens in schools, colleges, coaching institutes, and team meetings as well. Apart from this, a large number of websites also cause limitations for the blind since screen readers do not support reading everything. However, these problems can be resolved if we try to find the alternatives, and share our experiences, learnings, and list of resources with those who have already passed through these stages. I will list down the resources that I used in school, college, and for other preparations as well in my future posts.</p>
