          <h2><span class="alt1">Childhood</span></h2>
          <p>
            My childhood was a complex tapestry woven with both wonder and deep adversity. At just six years old, I faced a severe medical crisis—contracting a critical condition that nearly claimed my life. I vividly recall the excruciating pain, the relentless treatments, and the overwhelming fear as my body battled to heal. The experience left me encased in layers of bandages and subjected to daily, painful baths in potassium permanganate.
          </p>
          <p>
            In those dark days, when doctors warned that I might not survive another day, the uncertainty of my future loomed large. Yet, amid the despair, my family’s unwavering love and support shone like a beacon. Their care, encouragement, and steadfast belief in my ability to overcome even the harshest challenges ignited a spark within me—a spark that has fueled my journey ever since.
          </p>
          <p>
            The trials of my early years taught me to value resilience, to find hope in the smallest moments, and to understand that every setback is an opportunity to rise stronger. These formative experiences not only shaped my character but also instilled in me the determination to make a difference in the world.

            My academic journey is a testament to grit, passion, and relentless determination. In Class X, I achieved an impressive 9.6/10 CGPA, and in Class XII, I topped the commerce stream with an outstanding 94%, setting the stage for a future defined by excellence. Each academic milestone reaffirmed my belief that hard work and perseverance can shatter even the most daunting obstacles.
          </p>
          <p>
            After clearing the CAT Examination, I received call-ups from all three top IIMs in India—IIM Ahmedabad, IIM Calcutta, and IIM Bangalore. Choosing to pursue my MBA at IIM Ahmedabad, I continue to develop robust leadership and strategic skills that will shape my future endeavors. My undergraduate studies at Keshav Mahavidyalaya, University of Delhi, laid the groundwork in commerce and business strategy, preparing me for the competitive world of business.

            Every milestone in my life is not just a personal victory, but a powerful testament to overcoming adversity. I have been honored as an International Medallist by the Government of India, received the prestigious HCL Young Achievers Excellence Award, and earned a silver medal at the Global IT Challenge for Youth with Disabilities in Vietnam. These accolades are emblematic of countless hours of hard work, determination, and the courage to push beyond perceived limitations.

          <p>
            Living with visual impairment has presented a unique set of challenges that have tested my resolve and sparked my innovation. From grappling with an education system that wasn’t designed for accessibility to contending with widespread social stereotypes, each challenge has pushed me to find creative solutions—whether that means recording lectures, relying on assistive technology, or developing new study strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Social interactions, too, have been fraught with misconceptions and unintentional biases. Questions about how I manage everyday tasks often remind me of the narrow expectations society holds for those with disabilities. Yet, every obstacle has deepened my empathy and strengthened my commitment to advocate for change, proving that with determination, even the most daunting challenges can be transformed into opportunities for growth.

            Leadership, for me, is about inspiring change and nurturing growth in others.
