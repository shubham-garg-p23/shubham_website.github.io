    <h2>Responsibilities of People with Diversity or Disability</h2>

    <p>In this final post of my weekly series, I would like to talk about a few things that we, the people belonging to diversity or disability, should also consider and practice so that others may provide us with an inclusive world.</p>

    <p>We people with diversity and disability should understand that we also have equal responsibilities before claiming anything from society, some of which I have listed below:</p>

    <h3>1. Never Take Undue Advantage</h3>
    <p>Never take undue advantage of the trust, faith, empathy, acceptance, relaxations, flexibilities, facilities, and opportunities provided due to our diversity or disability. We should be honest on our part because our wrongdoings can close the doors and snatch the opportunities of so many individuals in need.</p>

    <h3>2. Utilize Our Potential</h3>
    <p>We should utilize our potential, work to the best of our abilities, and show the world that we are capable enough to claim ourselves equal and what we deserve, rather than always depending upon the policies and various departments for the support wherever possible.</p>

    <h3>3. Accept Our Differences</h3>
    <p>Accept that we are different and work on how we can make others accept that we are no different. We may indeed have some constraints that would limit us from undertaking a few tasks. And we should accept this, but how we can replicate that limitation with our other skills and abilities should be the main focus.</p>

    <h3>4. Integrate with the Mainstream</h3>
    <p>Never hesitate to include ourselves among the people with the ability to see, instead of always living in the community of the diversity or disability we belong to. By living with such people, we will be able to demonstrate how we are equal, what we can do, change their perspective towards the people with diversity and disability, and make the world inclusive in real terms.</p>

    <h3>5. Help Others from the Same Community</h3>
    <p>Always try to help people coming from the same diversity or disability you belong to, who are suffering from the challenges that you have been through, or who lack guidance/information/support by spreading knowledge, sharing your experiences, creating awareness, and being their friend/mentor.</p>

    <h3>6. Contribute to Society</h3>
    <p>Whenever we are in a situation/position where we may contribute something for the well-being of society or give back to society, we should never forget to do so.</p>
