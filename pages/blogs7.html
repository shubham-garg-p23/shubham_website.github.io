    <h1>Raising Awareness: Changing Perspectives on Disability</h1>
    <h2>Understanding and Respecting People with Blindness</h2>

    <p>In this post, I would like to share some simple and respectful ways to interact with people who are blind. Understanding and communication go both ways, and these small changes in behavior can make a world of difference. Here are some points to keep in mind:</p>

    <h3>1. Speak Directly to Me</h3>
    <p>I'm an ordinary person, just blind. You don't need to raise your voice, or ask my companion what I want. Please ask me directly. Talk to me so that we may understand each other better.</p>

    <h3>2. Allow Me to Guide the Way</h3>
    <p>If I'm walking with you, don't grab my arms, let me take yours. I'll keep a half step behind to anticipate curbs and steps. You may not need to be overcautious and make a full stop at every step. Walk normally, and your body movement will tell me what to do.</p>

    <h3>3. Offer Assistance When Needed</h3>
    <p>When you see me standing alone, don't hesitate to offer assistance. Just tap slightly on my shoulder and say "Excuse me" or "Hello" to call my attention instead of whispering behind my back.</p>

    <h3>4. Speak When You Enter a Room</h3>
    <p>I want to know who's in the room with me, so please speak when you enter. It is helpful to mention your name or say "Hello" each time we meet, especially for new acquaintances, so that the sound of your voice will be familiar and recognizable to me. Introduce me to the others, including children, and tell me if there's a cat or a dog. Guide my hand to a chair by letting me touch the backrest.</p>

    <h3>5. Ensure Doors and Cabinets are Fully Closed</h3>
    <p>The door to a room, cabinet, or car left partially open is a hazard to me. Please try to leave doors or rooms or cabinet drawers fully opened or closed. I also need a sense of permanence in the room or in the drawer. Classroom fixtures must have their designated places so that I can memorize the place. Don't leave chairs or bags in the middle of the room because I might trip over them.</p>

    <h3>6. Help Me with Table Positioning</h3>
    <p>At meal times, I won't have trouble with ordinary table skills. Use the clock method when describing the food on my plate or the position of my cup of coffee. For example, 12:00 to tell me that my viand is at the uppermost center of my plate, 11:00 if my glass of water is at the upper left side, etc.</p>

    <h3>7. Don’t Avoid Words Like “See”</h3>
    <p>Don't avoid words like "see," I use it too. I'm always glad to see you. My sense of smell, touch, or hearing did not improve when I turned blind. I rely on them more and, therefore, may get more information through those senses than others do.</p>

    <h3>8. Show Me Important Spaces at Your Home</h3>
    <p>If I'm your house guest, show me the bathroom, closet, dresser, windows, and the light switch too. I like to know whether the lights are on.</p>

    <h3>9. Don’t Hesitate to Ask About Blindness</h3>
    <p>I'll discuss blindness with you if you are curious, but it's an old story to me. I have as many interests as you do. However, don't be afraid to ask questions. We blind people are more than willing to explain everything you want to know about blindness. It's better to clarify things you don't understand than to make hasty assumptions. Remember, questions don't hurt, ignorance does.</p>

    <h3>10. Include Me in Activities</h3>
    <p>Please make me a part of your world. I also enjoy the same things you do: parties, movies, shopping, and competitions. Let me participate in any of your activities, and you'll be surprised that I can be as fun as the person next to you.</p>

    <h3>11. See Me as a Person First</h3>
    <p>Don't think of me as just a blind person. I'm just a person who happens to be blind.</p>

    <h3>12. Walk Beside Me, Not Behind or Ahead</h3>
    <p>Don't walk behind me; I may not lead. Don't walk in front of me; I may not follow. Just walk beside me, as a friend! Blind eyes are better than blind minds.</p>
