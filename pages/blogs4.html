    <h1>Embracing Diversity: Disability and Inclusion – Part 3</h1>
    <h2>Education</h2>

    <p>Education is very crucial for uplifting a certain section of society, changing the perspective of people, providing them equal space in society, making them skilled individuals, and transforming them into noble citizens.</p>

    <p>The education status of people with disability in our country is indeed improving gradually. In the current scenario, the number of blinds opting for the subjects of commerce and science has gone up in the last decade, but there is a long way to go compared to blinds who study humanities subjects or remain uneducated.</p>

    <p>Also, many of the PWDs are not able to leverage the opportunity of education to acquire skills, broaden their thinking, learn, grow, and develop. In fact, for a large portion of PWDs in our country, different levels of education are still being considered as eligibility that they need to meet to appear in government jobs examinations.</p>

    <p>Now, the question comes: even after so many efforts of government, NGOs, corporates, and other support systems, why is it still happening?</p>

    <p>According to me, there are the following reasons for this:</p>

    <h2>1. Lack of Awareness:</h2>
    <p>This is a root cause of most of the problems persisting in our society. Many of the people with disabilities and their families are not much aware of the need and importance of education, and from where to acquire it. Most of the time, they also do not know about the rights, regulations, and policies regarding their education, assistive technology to support their education, information on what options are available to them, and from where they can get support. Even most of the families of people with disabilities who are living in tier 1 cities are also not aware of all these questions. The first thought that comes to their mind is to send them to a specialized school. However, it is not important at all that one can only acquire education from such specialized institutions, at least in the case of people with visual impairment.</p>

    <p>In my case, while I was recovering from the Stephen Johnson Syndrome and adapting to blindness, I was in class 2 at Kendriya Vidyalaya. At that time, my parents had decided that they would not stop my education and would not send me to any special school for blinds. Because they wanted me to grow by tackling the challenges while making my space among the people with the ability to see. Initially, it was a tough thing to do, children used to bully me, but due to the motivation from my parents and teachers, I survived that phase and it helped me to stretch my abilities, and learn relationship-building and communication skills along with learning my school curriculum. Also, it helped me to find ways to overcome challenges right from childhood. After learning Braille from a school for blinds, I came to know about the organizations that advocate and support the education of people with disabilities, and regulations like using a scribe, additional 1/3 time of total duration to complete my exam, 4% of reservation in admission to most of the institutions and for government examinations, and technologies like screen reader software, etc.</p>

    <h2>2. Unwillingness of Institutions to Teach:</h2>
    <p>If people have awareness, then another hurdle that comes in their way is the unwillingness of institutions to teach PWDs. Even after the government policies that no one can be denied admission to any educational institution on account of someone’s disability, still many educational institutions do not accept students with disabilities, stating they don’t have the specialized resources and instructors, or know how to handle such students. As per my understanding, no such resources are being required for teaching a blind student. But on the other hand, blinds and PWDs are also not able to convince these institutions to take them by showing their potential or helping them to understand that it is not that tough to teach them. Also, to thrive in today’s world, merely acquiring education from school is not sufficient for all the students to clear the various competitive examinations. The coaching institutions are not willing to teach people with disabilities, stating they won’t be able to pay more attention to such children, or these students will not be able to catch up with other students and their pace of learning, and they can’t hamper the progress of a large batch of students because of one such child.</p>

    <p>For example, when I turned blind, my school denied me entry into the school, saying that we don’t teach blind students and what if this disease would spread to other students. When my parents explained I suffered a medical reaction, not an infection, they said please send him to any blind school. After a lot of arguments, my entry was permitted after most of the teachers said we don’t have any problem teaching him, and I passed the skill and knowledge test. Also, I wanted to make my career in the domain of AI, for that, I wanted to pursue science subjects in high school, and prepare for engineering colleges. Since my school was aware of my potential, they allowed me to opt for the science stream. But when I approached the coaching institutes to help me prepare for entrance exams of engineering colleges like JEE, I got to hear all that I mentioned above.</p>

    <h2>3. Finance:</h2>
    <p>Another challenge is insufficient finance. Either most of the families don’t have the finance to support the expenses to meet the education of a PWD child, or those who have, don’t want to spend that on education. These days, assistive technologies are accessible and pocket-friendly for PWDs, but still, it is far from reach for so many middle-class families that cannot afford its cost. Also, the alternative of private tutors for the institutions that I mentioned above is quite expensive, due to which many of the blinds and PWDs are not able to study science and commerce subjects. Apart from that, reaching the NGOs and organizations that support PWDs in their education is not possible for many of the PWD students because either they cannot afford traveling expenses and time to travel, or there is no one in the family to support them all the time by leaving their work.</p>

    <p>For example, although I had the computer to install a screen-reader and utilize its benefits, the special school in my area did not teach computers to the blinds who have not completed a certain level of educational qualification, and the school which could teach me computers was very far from my home. The private tutor that my parents were able to find taught me to use a screen-reader and operate a computer, but it was very expensive for a middle-class family. Similarly, since private tutors are very expensive, I had to drop the dream of studying science as well, and shifted to commerce since I had my uncle who runs a coaching institute for commerce subjects.</p>
